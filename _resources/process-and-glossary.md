There's more to design than meets the eye! ðŸ‘€ In fact â€” after negotiating a [contract](/resources/contract/) â€” every project I work on starts with a research phase. And before starting with design or code we spend time together setting goals and workshopping content and organization.

(Of course, the process for every project is a little bit different, but what you see below is a pretty typical outline.)

## 1. Plan
{:.fuchsia}

**Pre-research and Scoping**

* Ask the [Project starter questions](/resources/questions){:.bold}

* Identify project stakeholders, site editors, and target audiences.
* Outline key questions, process, strategy, goals, recommendations, technology.

## 2. Design
{:.fuchsia}

**Content Strategy**  
Articulate flexible guidelines to help promote cohesive messaging, tone, and style.

**Information Architecture**  
Audit existing content and structure. Annotate issues with existing site design.

**Wireframes**  
Map out pages in low-fidelity.

**Visual Research**  
Ground the visual design by surveying historical materials, current landscape, and distant future.

**Mockups**  
Synthesize strategy, architecture, and research into a set of redesigned site templates.

## 3. Build
{:.fuchsia}

**Prototype**  
Create a live staging site demonstrating the breadth of designs and functionalities.

**Iterate**  
Gather late-stage feedback from stakeholders and incorporate back into prototype.

**Training**  
Train site editors on new structure.

**Content Migration**  
Merge, import, and clean up existing site content, in collaboration with site editors.

**Testing**  
Soft-launch prototype and gather feedback from a wider audience.

## 4. Launch
{:.fuchsia}

## 5. Debrief
{:.fuchsia}

Reflect on initial scope, goals, and plan for evaluating initial performance measures. Is everything working as planned? Did we meet our goals? What are future areas of improvement?
