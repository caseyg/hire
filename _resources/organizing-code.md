## How I Write CSS
For a small site on which I’m the only maintainer, but which I want to be able to return to a year later and quickly pick back up.

Also, when I’m coding, I don’t want to think about the right place to put rules.


### Pre-Existing CSS

I typically use a framework like Bootstrap.


### Organization

Use a Table of Contents.


### Linter


### Workflow

Build refactoring into your process. These are paid hours that you budget and bill for, which don’t add any features, but where you spend time re-organizing your work. In a project without periodic refactoring, productivity goes down as complexities mount. Periodic refactoring ensures that development remains nimble.


### Table of Contents

### Variables

For colors.
Magic numbers.

### Nesting

Avoid nesting.


### Naming

`.block__element--modifier`


### Methodologies

BEM


### SASS

Use CSS wherever possible. Portability. Future-proof-i-ness.

### Tools

- scss-lint
- css-comb
- autoprefixer
