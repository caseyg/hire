# Casey Gollan

<div class="h3" markdown="1">
Hi, I've been making websites for work for nearly a decade (and almost twice as long for fun). And I'm a generalist who enjoys working across disciplines to see a project through from end-to-end.
{:.h2}

Over the last several years, I've worked primarily with clients in the fields of education and art on how to use design to communicate strategically online.

Aside from web design, I'm experienced in print design and production. I recently designed a [400-page book on Nordic Larp](http://knutepunkt.org/book/), and helped start a risograph press in Brooklyn.

My week is split about half-and-half: when I'm not working on design/development projects, I'm a working artist. I currently [teach](http://projectsthecooperunion.wiki/view/Main_Page) at The Cooper Union as a visiting artist in the School of Art, recently exhibited in the [Whitney Biennial](whitney.org/Exhibitions/2017Biennial#artists-22), and was a 2015-17 Fellow at the [Vera List Center for Art and Politics](http://www.veralistcenter.org/engage/people/1991/victoria-sobel-and-casey-gollan/) at The New School.

My writing on design and technology has been published at [Rhizome](http://rhizome.org/editorial/2012/jan/23/book-review-programmed-visions-software-and-memory/) and [Poool](http://pooool.info/user-generated-content/). I've participated in [Triple Canopyâ€™s networked publishing intensive](https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/a-note-on-triple-canopys-summer-intensive) and the [New School Publishing Institute](https://www.newschool.edu/publishing-institute/). I helped start the [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io/), as its first administrator, experimenting with [open-source finances](https://github.com/SFPC/finance-and-administration).
