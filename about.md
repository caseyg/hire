# Casey Gollan

<div class="h3" markdown="1">
I've been making websites for work for nearly a decade (and almost twice as long for fun), but I'm a generalist who enjoys working across disciplines to see a project through from end-to-end.
{:.h2}

Aside from web design, I'm experienced in print design and production. I helped start a small risograph press in Brooklyn.

My week is split about half-and-half: when I'm not working on design/development projects, I'm a working artist. I currently teach at The Cooper Union as a visiting artist in the School of Art, recently exhibited in the 2017 Whitney Biennial, and was a 2015-17 Fellow at the Vera List Center for Art and Politics at The New School.

My writing on design and technology has been published at Rhizome and Poool, and I've participated in Triple Canopyâ€™s networked publishing intensive and the New School Publishing Institute. I helped start the School for Poetic Computation, as its first administrator, experimenting with open-source educational institutions.
