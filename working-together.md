My favorite kind of project is highly collaborative and process-oriented, unfolding through a series of conversations, exercises, and feedback sessions. I ask questions that help articulate your audiences and goals; draw out the stories and aesthetics behind your work; sketch out a structure and form that communicates effectively; and build you a website that is solid, reader-friendly, and easy to maintain.
