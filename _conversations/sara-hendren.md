I've been working with Casey Gollan on a site re-design: a one-in-three-in-one structure for Abler, my long running blog, a new site to house the projects of my lab at Olin College, and a personal site for other projects, writing, reading notes, and so on.

Casey

 In building the sites, Sara and I had such exciting discussions — about web design, accessibility, and what it means to build a home on the internet in 2016 — that we decided early on to work in public and put together some documentation on the thinking and research that went into it all.

Differently from my typical freelance projects, where a client sends me a brief and I come back in a few weeks with an almost-finished website, Sara and I met via Google Hangouts every week or two, and sometimes several times in one week, to talk, think out loud, and work on the site together. It’s been a true collab.
We’ve been working ambiently on this since September 2015, when Sara first got in touch via Twitter to see if I’d be up for helping pull together a PDF(!) of recent projects.

Fast forward almost a year, and we’re putting out this initial documentation, and launching the first of three websites: starting with the Lab.

\[There’s a lot more we want to do.]

## Why redesign?

Sara
{:.speaker--sara}

Abler was started in 2009 as a way to create a portfolio site that was also a blog about prosthetics—in both the art and engineering senses—and adaptive design, transhumanism, cyborg futures, that kind of thing. I wanted not just to have a gallery of my own stuff online; I wanted an online space that was generative and collegial, a place where I could document my own learning and collect that of others.

_The existing Abler, with a jumble of tabs and reverse-chronological stream._
Over time, however, my work started straining the edges of the Wordpress blog format I’d chosen. I didn’t want all the writing to be chronologically filed, and I didn’t know how to organize my own projects: ongoing, extended collaborative partnerships. I started working full time at Olin College as a professor in 2014, too, so I needed to indicate some institutional work and research while maintaining my own separate practices.
In ways I didn’t realize early on, Abler has provided a way for me to write myself into a hybrid, interdisciplinary practice. I’m a design researcher but also an artist, a professor, and a writer.
I wanted a way to both link together and clearly distinguish all these various efforts. I also wanted to keep up the possibility of exploring things online in words before ideas become artifacts, and vice versa.

## Website as home

Sara
{:.speaker--sara}

I wanted a site that would do a lot of things at once, because I’m depending on the online space for lots of things that can’t happen in material life.
That’s partly philosophical: it’s always been important to me to have a multimedia practice where each individual project takes on new meaning in adjacency to different kinds of projects. Some of the work is engineering; some of it is art; and some of it is design. I want it not to matter so much what gets called what, but I do want to make a case that these three things might live together far more productively than they currently do. On the original Abler, the design logic I chose was that of a magazine or collage: multiplicity, variety, weird juxtapositions. I’m trying to preserve that spirit on the Abler channel of the new site, while also letting my own projects—and those of my lab—live nearby but also separately from that archive of other people’s work.
But the new design is also practical: I care a lot about connecting with a dispersed community of creative people in art, design, technology, engineering, and more. I also have three small children whose growing up I don’t want to miss. I need an online space to be a real workhorse: to do lots of things for me when I can’t show up in the flesh. This is a holdover from the original Abler, too, which was significantly written in its early days while also dealing with months of morning sickness, or while breastfeeding, or while a baby napped. I only learned the power of the digital space when I became a parent who also had an in-betweeny, hard-to-name profession.
So what to do?

## Content strategy

Casey
{:.speaker--casey}


To figure out what we were already working with, we used a kinda janky tool called BlogBook to “audit” (print out) 7 years of Abler posts. We found a lot of different kinds of content crammed into one blog, as Abler had shape-shifted over the years. Rearranging all this content was a helpful mental exercise in identifying things that are misplaced (projects buried in the stream, or a course syllabus linked in the header), and also missing pieces of content.

We’d done a bit of noodling with look and feel, but seeing the BlogBook made me realize we were in need of content _strategy_. For this, we used a lot of ideas and exercises from Nicole Fenton and Kate Kiefer Lee’s [Nicely Said: ][_Writing for the Web with Style and Purpose_]. \[Also the toast redesign.]

We mapped out different types of readers — that includes you, hello! — and thought about the different kinds of messages we’re trying to convey to each.

{:.speaker--sara}

For the lab site I wanted a place where potential collaborators and supporters could see the lively work happening, but also make sense of it as a distinct lab, run by a faculty member in a university setting.
I wanted Abler to be the rangey-magazine-archive it’s always been, without getting clogged up with my own projects.
And I wanted to be able to write about my own work, publish essays or point to talks, and just think aloud on my own site.
I wanted the online architecture to link and separate all those things. It took us a long time to figure it all out.

Another exercise called “This But Not That” helped us generate some descriptive parameters: “Heady but not obtuse. A constellation but not a spectacle. Solicitous but not selling anything.” These sound abstract, but are surprisingly useful to consider while making design decisions.  Flexible ranges are a nice alternative to buzzwordy art direction like,  _“It should feel dynamic!” _or _“Can we make it fresh-er?_”.

## Three new unified channels

Casey
{:.speaker--casey}


Initially I’d been thinking that we could just re-organize the tabs on Abler to make room for some new stuff. However, taking a loosely goal-oriented approach made us realize pretty quickly that we could identify three separate sites, each with an overlapping but distinct readership, structure, tone, and texture.

(img)
_The flat navigation from the existing Abler site didn’t offer much room for different kinds of work, or provide any way of bringing clarity to the complexity._

We played around with different ways of stacking the sites: does the Lab make sense as part of Abler? Or should Abler become a publication of Lab? And where is Sara in all of this? Should the Lab and Abler be two sections of a site for Sara’s projects?

Until nearly the end of this process, we were trying to think of some mysterious _fourth thing_ that could serve as an “umbrella” or splash page for these three sites.

Unstacking the sites, we realized we could organize them as three distinct but adjoining channels. Each of the sites stands on its own, at its own domain, but the three will (when they’re all online) be intertwined navigationally, frequently cross-reference each other, and share a design language as well as a codebase.

_Workshopping navigation between and within sites. Designing for small screens first helps avoid navigation clutter. Using a visual metaphor of stacked pages on a “table” which the three sites share, made it close but not all the way to the final cut. It felt a little bit campy and claustrophobic._

Accessibility as a site of expression

Casey
{:.speaker--casey}


We also realized that while Abler isn’t exactly broken, there’s a lot we could do to improve the way it’s organized. We made a list of ideas, from cleaning up the display of lists, to writing some short topical guides to the archive. Our biggest priority: we weren’t so sure that it was even very accessible.
 _**Sara**_Abler always had good alt text image descriptions in its posts, but I knew there was far more to be done on digital accessibility. Casey did a huge amount of research to try and figure out the state of the art, and we tried to think as creatively as possible about altering the default modes of the web. We were inspired by the [Floe Project], but also by [Spoken Layer] and [Verse by Voice].

\[Karlssonwilker spoken portfolio]
Basics:
- Passed automatic accessibility tests and checklists X, Y, and Z.
(img)(img)

- Compliant with standards and guidelines X, Y, and Z. WCAG, etc.
- Using semantic markup and ARIA roles, etc.
- Engaged Person/Group X to do actual accessibility QA testing of the final site.
### Beyond compliance: Access as a site of expression
- Could screen reader compatibility, and other points of access, be sites of expression, not just compliance? As we draw out some expressive and playful qualities of accessible design, can we bring or translate that to all readers?
### Designing from audio-first
- The standard approach to web design in 2016 is to start “mobile-first” (e.g. iPhone) and progressively enhance for larger and more powerful devices (e.g. iMac). For these sites we wanted to start from audio-first.
- How do these sites sound, for non-sighted readers?
- Can we do better than the default in terms of functionality and expressiveness of these sites’ audible interface?
- Starting with the Welcome message at the top of every top-level page, but extending through the way the navigation sounds, considering inviting narration of posts, verse-by-voice style.
(img)
### Supporting uncommon inputs
- It’s standard to do device testing, but oftentimes only across a range of expensive Apple devices on a high speed Fiber Optic network connection. We sought to make these sites work across a range of devices, including Android and open-source operating systems, and including full keyboard navigation, verified compatibility with major screen reading software such as Jaws and Voiceover, and consideration of additional reader input devices like eye-tracking navigation (any other inputs/outputs that come to mind? or is this too ambitious, even??).

Foregrounding customization, for all readers.
- The problem with minimalism.
	- Trendy Silicon Valley minimalism (or whatever you wanna call it) hides user customization options, consequently excluding broad swaths of people.
- These sites provide all readers, front and center, with a considered but highly customizable set of options for type, color, emphasis, and complexity. On your first visit we’ll encourage you to set your customizations, and store them using a browser cookie. You can edit your customizations at any time. -Defamiliarizing aesthetics of access.
	- No default colors, here! We sought to design a set of options that’s broadly useful and inclusive, and also pleasing to explore. These options shouldn’t be something tucked in a drawer or slapped on as an afterthought.

### Open source, open license
- All aspects of the site — content, design, and code — are freely downloadable, open source, well documented in plain language, and permissively licensed through Creative Commons (except where otherwise noted).
### Soliciting your feedback and variations
- Does this work for you? We’re listening for how we can improve it.
- You’re invited to improve this site too, if you please. We’d love to link to or reincorporate your edits, transcriptions, translations, alternative formats, or other adaptations back into these sites, and give thanks to you for your contributions.

## Atomic design
The site’s design is a system based on the principles of “Atomic Design,” popularized by Brad Frost. It consists of small-to-large-sized building blocks that make the design and code easy to maintain, contribute to, and repurpose. It also provides consistency across the three sites. The style guide below breaks down the composition of this site’s Atomic elements, and provides sample visuals, code, and annotations.

## Code styles
Consistent and methodical code styles help make it easy to organize a project, jump into it as a newcomer, and return to its logic many months or years later.
